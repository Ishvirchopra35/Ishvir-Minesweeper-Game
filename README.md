# Minesweeper Game
The program is a Minesweeper game implemented in Python using the Pygame, Random, and OS Libraries with Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The purpose of the program is to have a graphical user interface for playing the classic Minesweeper game. The player is given a grid of tiles, some of which have hidden mines. The objective is to uncover all the tiles that donâ€™t have mines without triggering any other mines. The player can uncover tiles by left-clicking on them and they can flag tiles that they suspect may have mines by right-clicking on them. If the player clicks on a mine, they lose and the program will show them the locations of the other mines. **Execution instructions below.**
